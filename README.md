  ## Description
  This is a command-line application that manages a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
  <br/>
  My motivation to build this app was to improve the ability of a business owner to view employees, roles, departments, and salaries.
  <br/>
  I built this app to gain valuable knowledge and experience with back-end coding, using SQL, Node.js, and NPM Inquirer.
  <br/>
  This app solves the problem of strugling to view and understand employes roles.
  <br/>
  While building this app, I learned how to use SQL and how to connect it to other features like NPM and Node.JS.
